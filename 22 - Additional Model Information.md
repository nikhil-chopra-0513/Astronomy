For the ResNet model above, the entire code can be kept the same and only the architecture name needs to be changed in order to test out different architectures, this is true for most models apart from the Time Series Transformer and MiniRocket models which require a different code structure.
For this reason, and to keep this gist shorter, only the results (and not the code) of the following architectures have been kept:
- LSTM_FCN
- InceptionTime
- xresnet1d34
